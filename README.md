👋 Hi, I’m Grant

I’m beginning my journey into cybersecurity and cloud, focused on building strong fundamentals and documenting everything I learn along the way.

I’m especially interested in how cloud platforms can be secured, monitored, and hardened against real-world threats. My goal is to build a strong foundation in security fundamentals while developing hands-on experience with cloud environments, Linux, networking, and threat analysis.

This GitHub is where I keep my projects, lab notes, and learning progress as I move through my training. More to come as I grow.
