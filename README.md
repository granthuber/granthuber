## 👋 Hi, I’m Grant

I specialize in **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** with a focus on authentication, access governance, and cloud identity platforms. My GitHub showcases projects and labs centered around modern identity standards and enterprise IAM tools.

### Identity & Access Management Skills
- **Okta Administration:** SSO integrations, MFA, directory services, SCIM provisioning, lifecycle management  
- **Azure Entra ID:** Conditional Access, PIM, access reviews, enterprise app SSO, identity governance  
- **Identity Standards:** SAML, OIDC, OAuth 2.0, JWT, RBAC  
- **Security Principles:** Zero Trust architecture, least privilege, secure authentication flows  

### Projects & Labs
- **Okta SSO Implementations**  
  Configuring SAML and OIDC applications, MFA policies, and provisioning workflows.

- **Azure IAM Configurations**  
  Conditional Access enforcement, identity governance settings, PIM role management, and SSO integrations.

- **Identity Protocol Labs**  
  Practical demonstrations of authentication flows, token behavior, and federation concepts.

- **Lifecycle Automation**  
  Group-based access, provisioning logic, and access lifecycle rules aligned with IAM best practices.

### What You’ll Find Here
- Practical IAM configurations and examples  
- Documentation-style notes on identity protocols  
- Reusable templates for Okta and Entra ID setups  
- IAM-focused scripts, diagrams, and workflow explanations  

### Areas of Ongoing Interest
- Cloud identity governance  
- Authentication architecture and secure federation  
- Access lifecycle automation and policy design  
- Integrating Zero Trust principles across identity systems
